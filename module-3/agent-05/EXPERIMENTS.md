# EXPERIMENTS.md

Append-only log of approaches you tried. One entry per concrete attempt. See `references/exploration-discipline.md` for the why.

Schema:

```
## E<NN> — <one-line approach name>
- Hypothesis: why you thought this would help, in one line.
- What I changed vs E<NN-1>: the minimal diff.
- Result (dev): yaw <old> → <new> (Δ%); CTE <old> → <new> (Δ%).
- Verdict: keep | revert | revisit-later.
- Things this rules out: what you learned, even if the experiment failed.
```

Delete this header section once you start logging, but keep the schema close to mind.

---

## E00 — V0 baseline (no changes)
- Hypothesis: establish the floor we're trying to beat.
- What I changed vs nothing: nothing — predict() passes through `yaw_rate_pred_rads`.
- Result (dev): yaw 0.01456; CTE 147.44.
- Verdict: baseline.
- Things this rules out: nothing yet.
